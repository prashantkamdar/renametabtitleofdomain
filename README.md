#### Inspired by: [Rename Tab Title](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rename-tab-title/)

With the above Firefox extension, you are able to change the title of the Firefox window of any URL you visit. \
However, you will have to set it to for every page in that site individually, if you want all of them to be changed. \
With this Firefox extension, you are able to change the title of all pages of a site in one go, or each individually (if you so desire).

* If both tab & domain are set, "Tab title" is given higher preference over "Domain title"
* You can delete any title which is set using the "Delete" button next to it
* If "Tab title" is deleted, the "Domain title" will be honored (if it is set)
* Once a title is deleted (tab or domain), please reload the page for changes to reflect
* By default, in the textboxes, the current title is populated
